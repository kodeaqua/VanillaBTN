# Architecture decisions

## ADR-001: Isolate the Phase 0 build boundary

Date: 2026-10-25. Status: accepted, following AGENTS.md defaults.

Context: The matching project installs a PSX toolchain before project creation.
The native port must work independently and must not require proprietary SDK input.

Decision: Keep the native CMake project and its presets in `port/`. Begin with
a C11 fixed-width type/endian test. Preserve all matching source and link rules.
Prepare matching dependencies using verified archives on Linux, with a local
owner-supplied SDK. Port checks run without network or game assets.

Consequences: Run port presets from `port/`. A foundation build does not imply
game boot. Renderer selection, overlay namespacing, asset layout changes, Android
minimum SDK and native host-tool version pins remain unresolved. No enhancement
is enabled. Workflow/CI work is deferred by owner instruction.

## ADR-002: Bring up Windows first

Date: 2026-10-25. Status: accepted by explicit owner instruction.

Context: The original roadmap starts native bring-up on Linux. The owner asked
to prioritize Windows during Phase 0.

Decision: Bring up Windows x86-64 first, using project-local checksum-pinned
LLVM-mingw/UCRT, CMake and Ninja. Windows port builds must not depend on WSL,
a PSX SDK, or the matching toolchain. Retain the other desktop foundation
presets for later validation. Matching validation retains its Linux requirement.

Consequences: The first game boot target is now Windows. Android is deferred.
No renderer or runtime architecture decision changes. Release links use static
compiler runtime dependencies and the Windows system UCRT; system DLL imports
remain expected.

## ADR-003: Validate locally and defer CI

Date: 2026-10-25. Status: accepted by explicit owner instruction.

Context: The owner explicitly excluded workflows and CI from the current work.

Decision: Leave existing workflow files untouched; add no CI provisioning or
jobs. Validate the Windows foundation locally and document actual results.

Consequences: Roadmap and completion requirements for a CI skeleton are deferred.
Existing upstream workflow behavior is not validated or endorsed by this work.

## ADR-004: Exclude WSL from Windows port work

Date: 2026-10-25. Status: accepted by explicit owner instruction.

Context: The owner does not want WSL used for this work.

Decision: Build and validate the port with native Windows tools. Do not install,
invoke, or require WSL. Defer matching validation to a separate Linux host when
available, preserving the requirement to report an unverified matching baseline.

Consequences: An unavailable Linux matching toolchain does not block Windows
port progress. Matching source protection and honest validation reports remain
required. No claim of a successful matching check follows from Windows tests.

## ADR-005: Upgrade the Windows compiler for sanitizer startup

Date: 2026-10-25. Status: accepted within the existing LLVM-mingw toolchain choice.

Context: LLVM-mingw 20241001 / Clang 19.1.1 compiled the sanitizer targets but
ASan crashed before main with `interception_win: unhandled instruction`
(`44 0f b6 1a`). This matches the upstream Windows interceptor issue:
https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/issues/477.

Decision: Pin LLVM-mingw 20250709 / Clang 20.1.8 and its archive SHA-256.
Keep ASan and UBSan enabled together in `windows-asan-ubsan`; never suppress
the startup issue by disabling interceptors. Sanitizer builds use the toolchain's
ASan DLL on PATH; release builds retain static compiler runtime linkage.

Consequences: Setup downloads a new compiler archive once. The build wrapper
uses `cmake --fresh` to preserve preset options across compiler upgrades; CMake's
automatic compiler-change reconfiguration can otherwise discard options such
as HMBTN_SANITIZERS. Old ignored tool directories need not be deleted.

## ADR-006: Keep SDK words fixed-width and host descriptors native

Date: 2026-10-25. Status: accepted, following the existing memory/type defaults.

Context: Windows host sys/types.h does not provide the SDK's u_long spelling.
Using host long for it would also become 64-bit on LP64 platforms. GPU packet
words must remain 32-bit while host pointers must retain their full width.

Decision: Force-include `compat/game.h` only in game-facing translation units.
It loads host sys/types.h first, then maps u_char/u_short/u_long to namespaced
fixed-width aliases. Do not redefine the C keyword long or force this mapping
into the platform/runtime targets. GPU packets use 32-bit tag words; GS ordering
table descriptors use native pointers. Assert packet and pointer-free asset
layouts without asserting the PS1 size of pointer-bearing host state.

Consequences: This establishes declarations and layout checks, not a GPU runtime
or a solution to truncated links in original LINK_PRIM. Original data loaders,
overlay dispatch and save serialization still need a separate 64-bit audit.

## ADR-007: Compile the original entry point before linking or executing it

Date: 2026-10-25. Status: accepted, following the separate native-build default.

Context: SDK declarations blocked main.c before native code generation. Even
after declaration fixes, its hardcoded work addresses and 32-bit pointer casts
make it unsafe to run on a native 64-bit host.

Decision: Compile unmodified main.c into the native game archive with a scoped
`main=hm_game_main` definition. Add its source-required SDK declarations and
compile afile.c in the same archive. Do not link or execute a game entry point
until native work memory, overlay dispatch and required runtime calls are ready.
Implement only the pure CD position helpers now; disc IO calls used by afile.c
abort explicitly. Other declared-but-unimplemented APIs remain link errors.

Consequences: Native code generation is verifiable without falsely claiming
boot. CdlFILE is source-facing search metadata containing only pos and size,
not a copied SDK ABI or an on-disc record. CdPosToInt reads exactly three bytes
because cd_audio.c passes the last three bytes of a GetlocP response. CdIntToPos
preserves the reserved fourth byte. Tested inputs cover normal two-digit BCD
positions, not malformed locations or arbitrary out-of-range LBAs.

## ADR-008: Back the asset/frame workspace with normal C storage

Date: 2026-10-25. Status: accepted, following the native memory default.

Context: main.c treats 0x801BE1B0 as a writable frame workspace. Its frame buffers
occupy 0x3EE50 bytes; the input demo and dynamically loaded farm data sit below
it. Replacing only the frame address would leave pointer subtraction outside
the allocated object. farm_state_init also derives its load window by subtracting
overlay code addresses, which does not apply to statically linked host overlays.

Decision: Use one aligned C byte array solely for this existing contiguous data
workspace, not a 2 MB PS1 memory image. Keep the 0x49000 image window, 0x47390
section/free capacity and 0x3EE50 frame work area. The capacity is derived from
the matching addresses: align the low-to-high region distance (0x75FC8) to
0x800 bytes, producing load window 0x8012DE20 and section start 0x80176E20;
the distance to WORK_REGION is then 0x47390. Native frame/tag offsets remain
unchanged. Overlay code and other globals/heap remain outside this storage.

Native source hooks will select the buffer and return a byte pointer from
main_get_region_base, preserving full host pointer width. Remaining overlay
callers that assign that pointer to 32-bit integers must fail compilation until
ported. The matching branches retain their original declarations and statements.
No save-format or asset-pointer compatibility is implied by this workspace.

Consequences: Frame/farm memory can be tested independently of GPU execution
and disc IO. Free-space budgets and demo overlap retain their vanilla meaning.
OT pointer encoding, overlay loading, asset bounds validation and the rest of
boot remain separate work. Matching check still requires an unavailable Linux
toolchain; textual branch preservation is additional evidence, not a substitute.

## ADR-009: Encode GPU links as stable handles to native tag pointers

Date: 2026-10-25. Status: accepted, following the fixed-width handle default.

Context: PS1 packet tags have an eight-bit command length and a 24-bit next
address. Truncating a native pointer can alias unrelated objects and cannot
represent 64-bit host addresses. The source links packets through SDK addPrim,
the LINK_PRIM macro, and ot_insert_prim; all three paths must agree.

Decision: Preserve packet layouts and replace only the address part with a
nonzero 24-bit handle. Keep 0xFFFFFF as the end marker. Assign handles in first-use
order, storing full native pointers in a bounded registry. Hash buckets are an
internal lookup detail; ASLR does not affect handle assignment. The initial
registry supports 65536 live tag addresses with a fixed 1 MiB allocation (pointer
array plus buckets) and no per-frame allocation. Exhaustion and malformed handles
abort with diagnostics rather than truncating, wrapping or silently succeeding.

ClearOTagR creates reverse tag chains. addPrim/AddPrim preserve both packet and
head lengths; the source-specific helpers retain LINK_PRIM/ot_insert_prim's
behavior of clearing the OT head length. setlen writes only the length byte,
without reading uninitialized address bytes. DrawOTag/rendering remain separate.

Consequences: Callers must keep registered tag objects alive and discard every
chain before resetting the registry. Do not reset it per frame; copied/cached
packet links must remain valid. Handles are process-local, not save-file data.
The registry validates identity/alignment, not allocation extents or payload
lengths; it is not an untrusted-memory sandbox or a cycle detector. Capacity and
runtime cost still need full-game/device profiling; no performance claim is made.
Matching source integrations must retain the exact original else branches.

## ADR-010: Keep native stacks and explicit diagnostic markers

Date: 2026-10-25. Status: accepted, following the native ABI/scratchpad default.

Context: cpu_asm.h switches to a MIPS scratchpad stack and stores return addresses
in 32-bit diagnostic words. Neither operation is valid on a 64-bit host. Source
inspection shows no game-data accesses to the saved scratchpad SP; lastCaller is
a diagnostic word also copied into save metadata, not an executable function pointer.

Decision: Native calls retain their normal ABI stack. Provide aligned 1 KB C
scratchpad storage and no-op only the stack-switch hints. SAVE_RETURN_ADDRESS
writes the deterministic 0x504F5254 PORT diagnostic marker instead of truncating
a host address. A game debugger-wait request reports a runtime error and aborts,
rather than emitting a MIPS break instruction or hanging the native process.
Keep all original CPU macros in an exact matching else branch when integrated.

The SDK csin/ccos/csqrt names are mapped to explicit fixed-math declarations,
avoiding collisions with the host C99 complex builtins. This does not yet
implement their arithmetic. Packet helpers implement only source-used fields
and GP0 encodings; video dimensions 320x240 follow the original main.c setup.

Consequences: These hooks unblock native compilation, not GTE functionality or
save-format parity. No approximation of an unimplemented GTE operation is added.
